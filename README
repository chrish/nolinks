nolinks is a fairly simple tool for the Wikimedia Toolserver. It's used to display all the articles missing an externallink, which in many cases mean that it's also 
missing references, which means that it should either be fixed or deleted. The tool is licensed under the BSD-license, and consists of two parts; ony python script that 
reads the enwiki_p database, and inserts data into the userdb u_bjelleklang, and a web frontend used to display the list of articles.
